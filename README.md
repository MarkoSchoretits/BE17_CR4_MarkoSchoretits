Over 80 = green

You can submit your solution (as GitHub project link) until Saturday at 18:00:00.


Project description:


Task: As a Full Stack Web Developer you got your first full-stack project, the Big Library web application. The customer wants you to create a big list of all media available in the library (books, CDs, DVDs) and make it available over the web.


The information that you will need to have in your DataBase is:

Consider them as hints for the columns for the table:

title, image (HTTP link to an image* or file name only), ISBN code, short_description, type (book, CD, DVD), author_ first_name, author_last_name, publisher_ name, publisher_address, publish_date.

Additionally, status (“available” or “reserved”)  required for Bonus Points.

*Feel free to choose if you would like to use:

file uploader as in prework

image name only and the images are already all available in a folder. You only need to make the reference in the DB.

Project Naming:

Create a GitHub Repository named: BE17-CR4-Name. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (LMS). Please make your repository private and collaborate with codefactorygit. See an example of a GitHub link below:

https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git.

 

For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

(20) Create a database and name it: BE17_CR4_YourName_BigLibrary. The database must have the name as specified in this task! 

(Please note that YourName must be exchanged by your name)


**Only one table is required for this CodeReview! **

(5) Add test data: at least 10 entries 

(20) Display List of Media: Fetch the media data from your database and display it on the browser.

(5) User-Friendly GUI: Create web-pages with a nice design using the Bootstrap framework or just HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

(20) Create form for Media. A user should be able to insert data into the database over the front-end form.

(20) Update form for Media: Create a form for updating the information from the Media that will be triggered by an Edit button.

(10) Delete Media: A user should be able to delete Media from the database by clicking on the Delete button.

Bonus Points:

(10) You should create a button - "Show details", that will be displayed together with every Media shown on the list. Once that button is clicked, all details regarding that specific Media (title, author, ISBN, short_description, and status (available or reserved) will be displayed on a new web page. In order to do that, a new file: details.php must be used.

(hint: take a closer look on the edit page, it may inspire you to do this task)

(10) Create a new file and name it publisher.php. When clicking on the Publisher's name on the index.html it should link the user to publisher.php and bring all Media published by that specific publisher only.

Note: Don’t forget to upload the PHP code together with your database.sql file to the GitHub repository. Please organize your project content (files) into folders according to their types.

Local DB backups have interfered with git-logic. Here is how to handle them:

- alphanumerical order corresponds to chronology

- filename in proper syntax without leading numbers corresponds to most recent version

In case if issues contact with your backend expert :)
